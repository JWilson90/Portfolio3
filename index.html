<p>Langford has a strong association with the settlement of the west coast.  One of the first settleres to come to the Westshore area is Captain Edward Langford.  Langford established a large 600 acre farm for The Husdon Bay Company in what is now known as Colwood.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of Langford, it has grown exponentially in the past few years.  This map will show some of the key areas in Langford that have undergone a transformation.</p>
